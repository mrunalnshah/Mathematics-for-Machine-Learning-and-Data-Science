    "# Exploratory Data Analysis - Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth notebook of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) series! In this notebook you will use the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) dataset, that you have already seen in the Pandas tutorial notebook. The dataset consists of 2199 rows, where each row contains various hapiness-related metrics for a certain country in a given year. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous video you have learned about one of the most common applications of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which is linear regression. Linear regression is a statistical model that is used to estimate a linear relationship between two or more variables. In case of simple linear regression you have one independent (explanatory) variable and one dependent variable (response), while in case of multiple linear regression, you have more than one explanatory variable. You can read more about linear regression on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will create your own linear regression model and fit it to one and more explanatory variables to predict the response. You will use an open-source, commercially usable machine learning toolkit called [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). This toolkit contains implementations of many machine learning and statistical algorithms that you can encounter as a data scientist or machine learning practitioner."

    "now that you have fit your model, it's time to start using it. In machine learning, a model like this is used not only to describe the data that you already have, but more importantly to create predictions based on new datapoints. To assess how well the model works, you have already split the dataset into the train and test sets, so that you can evaluate how the model performs on previously unseen data.\n",

To reinforce how the model actually works, you will compare the predictions given by `.predict()` with ones calculated \"by hand\", using the parameters W and b that you extracted in the previous cell."

In addition it calculates the feature importance. We will not go into detail about it here, but all you need to know is that importance score tells you the relative importance of explanatory variables. The higher the score, the more important the variable is in predicting the outcome.\n",
